<h2>Blog entry 1 </h2>
<p>Respond to the video 'Televangelist Oral Roberts' gay grandson says "it gets better"'(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYa0wi4XzeI)
: I saw a man speaking of who he is, what's his story is, and finally embracing his identity and share what he experienced through his life. He performs it making a video out of it. Also he choose to write a letter to his deceased uncle. How he do all this was really interesting to me. He performs this with several different components. First he shows us images containing his own hand writing. It tells us what's his background is and the purpose of his video. After that he reads his letter to deceased uncle. His feelings with him seems sympathetic and angry at the same time. I did feel sympathy with Robert who made this video. It was really interesting.

<h2>Blog entry 2</h2>       
<p>Respond to the Southpark season 10 episode:Make love, not war</p>
<p>Southpark generally targeted age of eighteen to fifty who is technically adults in United States. This episode of Southpark provokes the issue of having 'no life' when the audiences are so into the game. I personally enjoyed watching this episode because it has entertaining 'plots'. However, the message the creator tried to show us was somewhat vague. After defeating the grief Cartman said  'we can finally play the game' seemed silly to me.  It would have been nicer if they quite the game</p>

<h2>Blog entry 3</h2>
<p>To start off, I've got a goose bumps over this advertisement. It is so emotionally effective to persuade the audience.  I saw multiple footage that represents the 'good' image of Detroit and witness the advertisers tried to linked this image to Chrysler. Plus, Eminem's "Lose yourself" is played with the Chrysler vehicle appears after we saw 'good' image of Detroit city. 
Creating the brand image reaches its climax when the head copy 'imported from Detroit" shows up in the last scene. </p>
