		<p>I would have not become interested in public advertising if I did not fly to the Philippines. Flying to the Philippines helped me choose my future career. Due to flight technology, I was able to observed incredible poverty. I chose public advertising for my future career because I wanted to engage many people as I could and publicize my thoughts. Having seen the poverty in Manila inspired me. Not only flight technology inspired me to have a dream, but also led me to study world-wide. I am used flight technology because my experience in flying is numerous even before I get into the college. When I got into Michigan State, my dream became much more vivid.</p>
	<p>Among many fields of academic degree program provided by public and private institutions, I chose creative advertising specialized in design in Michigan State University.  My story starts from a studying abroad program interview.  I failed at the interview, which required certain credit since it was supervised from the city government. When interviewer asked me what I want to do in the future and why, I could not answer it. I mumbled and hesitated. After brief interview, I got home and laid in my bed. I pondered why I could not answer the simple question. A couple of hours later, I came up with a thought. My future, including  career and my soul dream job was ambiguous and even abstract as well. As a matter of fact, I did not know what I want for certain. This realization afflicted my daily life. I tried really hard to think of what I can to figure out what interested me the most, what I care about, and what I want to do with them. I was worrying even when eating cereals, studying, and walking from the school. Still concerned, my parents knew that I was having a rough time and they thought of a brilliant idea. They provided me an opportunity to go to Manila, Philippine for ‘the vision trip’ program sponsored by non-profit organization called ‘Compassion International’.</p>
	<p>It took me five hours to get there. Basically, what I had to do there is to witness what was happening in developing countries. As a part of the program, I have visited the world-famous unprivileged area called ‘slum’, located in Manila. It is infamous for its huge mountain of trash and crime. I met a family that lives beside a sewage for the village. Their house was built on top of the drain system, and the house shook and had a bad scent. I also went to the ‘grave yard village’ and met another family living in someone else’s coffin where they dug the corpse out and slept alternate with rest of the families. The important part of this story is, there always are children who are happy with their lives and their God. They smiled at me when I greeted them. It was like an angel’s bless for me with their prayer from heaven above.</p>
	<p>After this short trip, my question ‘what I want’ was answered. I organized my thoughts and realized what I had to do for communities and people. I wanted people to live better life. Everyone deserves to have food and a shelter to live on. Securing drinkable water should not be a struggle in daily life. For the most part, I wanted children who suffer from poverty to live better lives. They deserve a chance that will escape the vicious cycle of poverty inherited from older generations. They needed a proper sponsor who can pay them to go to school and feed them a lunch at school instead of their parents.</p>
	<p>Sudden inspiration became an eye-opener. It hugely impacted on set up goals for future. While motivation has been set up to do anything, I had to think of what I like, and enjoy the most for the career. I could go to developing countries and deal with situation on the ground. However, that was not what I do the best nor the best option for the career, to be honest. My interest leaned toward dealing with many people as I possibly can, publicizing the issues that should be taken care of.</p>
	<p>While I was glancing through a magazine after the trip, I saw one public service advertisement (PSA) that was created by Jae-Suk Lee. The image was visually shocking and its copywriting was catchy yet simple. He edited the photo of stairs at the subway entry combined the image with Mt Everest. His copy goes“For some, its Mt Everest”.Not only this PSA suggested me an insight on handicapped community but also taught me that advertisement is also a way to communicate between public and the artist. </p>
	<p>In my case, I have been desperately informing to my friends and family regarding the truth about poverty in developing countries since trip to Manila. I thought countries such as Philippine or India is not spot-lighted in media much like Sudan or Libya, etc. I met the real people in the Philippines. My interest on poverty had grown and it naturally led me to listen to other social issues, such as environment conflicts,  political tensions, and so on. In addition, I learned public advertisement can appeal to the public. I came upon a thought that PSA can somehow educate people. That was because its concept is generally outstanding and easily understandable. It can contribute to the social common good through medias such as press, TV, outdoors, etc. Most of all, it is not boring. So, people actually like it and spread the message to their friends and message, probably saying “Hey, you should totally check this out, its so cool.”.</p>
	<p>Since certain realization after trip, I chose to learn something and planned having a career in it. My pondering and wandering had gone and now I have vivid dreams. Everything would not have happened if I did not take the flight. Traveling continent to continent have not been possible without the flight technology we have now. 
	I came to the United States to be well-educated than any other country can provide me. I came here with ambitious American dream.  I flew all the way here from Korea. I picked Michigan State University because they have one of the best curriculums and programs for the advertising majors. Since I was little, I often visited uncle’s place in California for summer and winter vacation until I got into high school in Korea. It generally takes me 12 hours to get to California by flight from Korea. Yet, I loved staying in United States every time although it took some time to get to United States. Naturally, I got used to boarding on a flight.‘Studying aboard and planning a future career in worldwide’ idea started to grow up since I took my first flight heading to California. Flight heading to Manila fired up and became a key to plan my career. My passion towards something was built one taking a plane each time. Without the flight technology, choosing a path of where I am now would not have been existed. Publics can go to anywhere within Earth boundaries. Traveling from Asia to America, America to Africa, Africa to Europe within a day cannot precede without the Wright brothers’ invention of plane. Carrying more than one passenger would not have been placed if Sikorsky Ilya Muromets’ first commercial airline had not been launched. My dream could not be launched and fired up if there is no such technology.</p>
